# Step 2

The estimated evapotranspiration from the ensemble time series dataset is evaluated against the field-measured time series dataset with various performance metrics.

## Instructions:
### Conduct normality test, and performance metrics
** Conducted in R-studio using R-notebooks
- Conduct Shapiro-Wilks test for normality
- Conduct Correlation analysis 
- Calculate KGE and PBias

Performance metrics are calculated at each level including:
1) Overall
2) Log-transformed
3) Interannual
4) Seasonal
   * (a) Aggregate data to seasonal level in Python
   * (b) Performance metrics stattistics done in R
