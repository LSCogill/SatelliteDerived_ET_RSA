# Step 1

This step involves deriving a time series evapotranspiration (mm/month) dataset for each of the 14 flux tower sites using a mean ensemble model in Google Colab via the Earth Engine API.

## Instructions:
### Acquire ensemble ET time series dataset using the ensemble of best performing individual satellite-derived ET products
** Conducted in Google Colab using Python notebook
- Acquire ET time series datasets for each of the products in the ensemble
- Integrate the ET estimates from the best performing products into a mean ensemble and calculate min, max, and median as optional extras.
- Plot the ensemble mean with upper and lower limits (max and min ET) along with the field-measured ET
